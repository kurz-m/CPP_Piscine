n a kingdom far and wide, beneath a moon's pale light,
I stand still, silent, guarding day and night.
I'm not a soldier, though wars I've seen,
I'm not a king, though near thrones I've been.

Feathers I wear, but I never fly,
Time passes, seasons change, yet here I lie.
Rain or shine, in darkness or day,
I remain, never looking away.

What am I, with history so grand?
A sentinel, always there, upon the land.
